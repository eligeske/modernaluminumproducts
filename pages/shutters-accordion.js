    <h3>Accordion Shutters</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Miami Dade Approved</li>
      <li>Aesthetically Pleasing</li>
      <li>Optimum Hurricane Protection</li>
      <li>Closes with Ease</li>
      <li>Provides Security</li>
      <li>
        6.8 system has one of the tightest blade stacks in the industry; the
        blades in the open position only take up one inch per foot including
        center mate.
      </li>
      <li>
        The 6.8 system features an offset screw boss that allows for lubrication
        of the assembly screw and isolates the hinge from the corrosion effect
        from dissimilar metal contact.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assembly screws are JS-500 plated over 410 HT with zinc for better life
        span and increased durability.
      </li>
      <li>Uses significantly heavier track system than the competition.</li>
      <li>Uses a singular center mate, for less inventory requirements.</li>
      <li>
        Fast and simple locking procedure – close centers and push in key lock.
        Most other shutters require a six-step locking procedure.
      </li>
      <li>No lock bars required.</li>
      <li>Available in four colors – White, Bronze, Ivory and Beige.</li>
      <li>
        Available in a High Rise (H.R.) system which shares same components as
        the 6.8 accordion system with exception of blades, centers and starters.
      </li>
      <li>
        The H.R. system is used for high rise structures, which require
        extremely high wind loads.
      </li>
      <li>The H.R. system is also capable of spans up to 15’6”.</li>
    </ul>
